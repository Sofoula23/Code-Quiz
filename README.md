# Code-Quiz

For this homework I created a coding quiz based on color concepts.

To start the user sees a starting screen with a button to begin the quiz or high scores. Then once the user clicks the start button there's java script codes to hide the starting screen, start the timer, and display the questions and options the user can pick. If the user selects the correct question there is an alert to notify him/her, and then the next question appears. If the user selects the incorrect option, there is an alert to notify him/her and then the next question appears. Also, 15 seconds are substracted from the timer. 

Once the user answers the last question the questions and answers are hidden and a final score page is displayed where the user can enter their initials and see their score. The user's initials and score is stored in local storage. So if the user wants to refresh the page, their scores and initials will be saved. 

Once the game is over the user has the option to click a button to play again. 

The technologies used for this homework are HTML, CSS and Java Script.
